## Project Objectives
    Import and clean global COVID-19 datasets from reliable sources

    Analyze time trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations

    Compare key metrics across selected countries and regions

    Visualize trends with line charts, bar charts, and maps

    Communicate findings through a well-documented Jupyter Notebook report

## Tools and Libraries Used
    Python 3.x

    Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis and reporting

    pandas for data manipulation and cleaning

    matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

    plotly.express (optional) for interactive choropleth maps

    numpy for numerical operations

## How to Run / View the Project
    Clone the repository or download the project files.

    Download the COVID-19 dataset (owid-covid-data.csv) from Our World in Data and place it in the project folder.

    Install required libraries (if not already installed):


    bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly notebook
    Open the Jupyter Notebook:


    bash
    jupyter notebook covid19_analysis.ipynb
    Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis, visualizations, and insights.

    (Optional) Export the notebook as PDF or HTML for sharing.

## Insights & Reflections
    Vaccination rollouts varied significantly across countries, with some achieving rapid coverage while others lagged due to supply or hesitancy.

    Death rates showed disparities influenced by healthcare capacity, demographics, and variant waves.

    Visualization of cases and vaccination rates over time revealed clear pandemic waves and the impact of vaccination campaigns.

    Data completeness and reporting delays posed challenges, emphasizing the importance of data cleaning and validation.

    This project strengthened skills in data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and storytelling with data.
